							<p>Analysing, organizing, and visualizing this dataset was super interesting as it was something that affected nearly everyone at some point or another. There are numerous correlations that could be drawn from this data, but some of the more interesting ones were vaccination rates vs death rates, population vs death rates, and percentage infected vs population. Another insightful chart was an infection heat map that colorized each country by it's percent infected. I remembered hearing about covid being on the rise again at certain points during the pandemic, but it was insightful and fun to create visual representation of those said outbreaks. Some of my core takeaways from this project include working with heat maps, utilizing color palette, and creating visual clarity.</p>
